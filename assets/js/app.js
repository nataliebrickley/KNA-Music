// create one js file to deal with:
    // initial page
        // add event listener for main page submit button
        // on.click -> 
            // capture the text in the input form and feed it to firebase
            // open our main content page   
    
// Main Content Page
    // populate the page with pregenerated buttons
        // could TM feed us info on similar artists to populate our buttons with?     
    // add a button for the search term used on initial page - get the info from firebase
    // populate #main-content with information about the search term used on the initial page
        // Title of artist/band
        // Info on 3-5 next shows
            // date, venue, time permitting info from a wiki api
            // link to buy tickets for each show - tmAPI 
        // If you click the venue name (or create a button for this),
            // capture the venue address or perhaps just name and feed it to the googleAPI
            // change the img card/container/div to be a google map of the venue location 
    // add an img from tm API of the artist to the page 
        // this img will turn into the map when the venue button is clicked on 

        // listen for search click
